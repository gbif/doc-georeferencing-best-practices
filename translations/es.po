This document builds on the original https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-2zpf-zf42[Guide to Best Practices for Georeferencing (Chapman & Wieczorek 2006)^], which was one of the outputs from the BioGeomancer project (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040381[Guralnick et al. 2006^]). Several earlier projects and organizations (e.g. MaNIS, MaPSTeDI, INRAM, GEOLocate, NatureServe, CRIA, ERIN, CONABIO) had previously developed guidelines and tools for georeferencing, and these provided a good starting point for such a document. A detailed history of the organizations involved in the development of BioGeomancer and of the original Guide was given in that source. Throughout this document we reference tools and methodologies developed by those organizations and we acknowledge the valuable work by those organizations in their development. This document attempts to bring best practices up to date with terms, technologies, and georeferencing recommendations that have been developed and refined since the original document was published."

Precision is not the same as <<accuracy>> (see <<img-accuracy-vs-precision>>) because measurements can be consistently wrong (have the same error). Precise measurements of the same target will give similar results, accurate or not. We quantify precision as how specific a measurement should be to give consistent results. For example, a measuring device might give measurements to five decimal places (e.g. 3.14159), while repeated measurements of the same target with the same device are only consistent to four decimal places (e.g. 3.1416). We would say the precision is 0.0001 in the units of the measurement."

msgid "<<false precision,False precision>> refers to recorded values that have precision that is unwarranted by the original measurement. This is often an artefact of how data are stored, calculated, represented, or displayed. For example, a user interface might be designed to always display <<coordinates>> with five decimal places (e.g. 3.00000), demonstrating false precision for any coordinate that was not <<precision,precise>> (e.g. 3°, a <<latitude>> given only to the nearest degree). Because false precision can be undetectable, the actual precision of a measurement is something that should be captured explicitly rather than inferred from the representation of a value. This is particularly true for coordinates, which can suffer from false precision as a result of a format transformation. For example, 3°20’ has a precision of one minute, equivalent to about 0.0166667 degrees, but when stored as decimal degrees where five decimal places are retained and displayed the value would be 3.33333, with a false precision of 0.00001 degrees.

It is important that any identifiers used are globally unique (applied to exactly one instance of an identifiable object), persistent, and resolvable (https://doi.org/10.1186%2F1471-2105-10-S14-S5[Page 2009^], http://www.tdwg.org/standards/150[Richards 2010^], https://doi.org/10.35035/mjgq-d052[Richards et al. 2011^]).

As the GNSS satellites are at known positions in space, and the GPS/GNSS receiver can determine the distances to the detected satellites, the position on earth can be calculated. A minimum of four GNSS satellites is required to determine a position on the earth’s surface ({mcelroy_et_al_2007}[McElroy et al. 2007^], <<van-sickle,Van Sickle 2015>>). This is not generally a limitation today, as one can often receive signals from a large number of satellites (up to 20 or more in some areas). Note, however, that just because your GNSS receiver is showing lots of satellites, it doesn’t mean that all are being used as the receiver’s ability to make use of additional satellites may be limited by its computational power (https://novatel.com/support/knowledge-and-learning/gnss-book[Novatel 2015^]). In the past, many GPS units only referenced the GPS (USA) satellites of which there are currently 31 (April 2019), but now many GPS/GNSS receivers are designed to access systems from other countries as well – such as GLONASS (Russia), BeiDou-2 (China), Galileo (Europe), NAVIC (India), and QZSS (Japan), making a total of about 112 currently accessible satellites (2019) with a further 23 to be brought into operation over the next few years.

msgid "The latest US Government commitment (https://www.gps.gov/technical/ps/2008-SPS-performance-standard.pdf[US Deptartment of Defense and GPS Navstar 2008^]) is to broadcast the GPS signal in space \"_with a global average user range error (URE) of ≤7.8 m (25.6 ft.), with 95% probability_\". In reality, actual performance exceeds this, and in May 2016, the global average URE was ≤ 0.715 m (2.3 ft), 95% of the time (https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/[GPS.gov 2017^]). Though it does not mean that all receivers can obtain that accuracy, the accuracy of GPS receivers has improved and today most manufacturers of handheld GPS units promise errors of less than 5 meters in open areas when using four or more satellites. The need for four or more satellites to achieve these accuracies is because of the inaccuracies in the clocks of the GPS receivers as opposed to the much more accurate satellite clocks (https://novatel.com/support/knowledge-and-learning/gnss-book[Novatel 2015^]). The accuracy can be improved by averaging the results of multiple observations at a single location ({mcelroy_et_al_2007}[McElroy et al. 2007^]), and some modern GPS receivers that include averaging algorithms can bring the accuracy to around three meters or less. According to https://gisgeography.com/gps-accuracy-hdop-pdop-gdop-multipath[GISGeography 2019a^], “_A well-designed GPS receiver can achieve a horizontal accuracy of 3 meters or better and vertical accuracy of 5 meters or better 95% of the time. Augmented GPS systems can provide sub-meter accuracy_”. Another method to improve accuracy is to average over more than one GPS unit. Note that some GPS/<<GNSS>> receivers can record up to 20 decimal places of <<precision>>, but that doesn’t mean that is the accuracy of the unit."

msgid "The use of Differential <<GNSS>> (DGNSS) (incorporating Differential <<GPS>> (DGPS)) can improve <<accuracy>> considerably. DGNSS references a GNSS Base Station (usually a survey control point) at a known position to calibrate the receiving GNSS signal. The Base Station and handheld GNSS receiver reference the satellites’ positions at the same time and thus reduces <<error>> due to atmospheric conditions, as well as (to a lesser extent) satellite ephemeris (orbital location) and clock error (https://novatel.com/support/knowledge-and-learning/gnss-book[Novatel 2015^]). The handheld GNSS instrument applies the appropriate corrections to the determined position. Depending on the <<data quality,quality>> of the receivers used, one can expect an accuracy of <1 meter (https://water.usgs.gov/osw/gps/[USGS 2017^]). This accuracy decreases as the distance of the receiver from the Base Station increases. It is important to note that differential technology is not available in all areas – for example, in remote <<location,locations>> and remote islands, and the resulting accuracy may be less than expected. Again, averaging can further improve on these values ({mcelroy_et_al_2007}[McElroy et al. 2007^]). It is important to note, however, that most DGNSS is post-processed. Records are stored in the GPS/GNSS unit and then post-processing software is run to improve the measurements once connected to a computer. Post processing is not as commonly used since the introduction of real-time DGNSS, such as the <<SBAS,Satellite Based Augmentation System>>, see the next subsection below), and is now used mostly in surveying applications where high accuracy is required."

SBAS receivers are inexpensive examples of real-time differential correction. SBAS uses a network of ground-based reference stations to measure small variations in the GNSS satellite signals. Measurements from the reference stations are routed to master stations, which queue the received Deviation Correction (DC) and send the correction messages to geostationary satellites. Those satellites broadcast the correction messages back to Earth, where SBAS-enabled <<GPS>>/GNSS receivers use the corrections while computing their positions to improve accuracy. Separate corrections are calculated for ionospheric delay, satellite timing, and satellite orbits (ephemerides), which allows <<error>> corrections to be processed separately, if appropriate, by the user application."

Local and regional DEMs may have a smaller grid size. For example, a 5 m grid in Australia, which has a vertical accuracy better than one meter, and even to 0.3 meter in some areas (https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/89644[Geoscience Australia 2018^]) or the European Digital Elevation Model, which has an accuracy of better than three meters (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8030108[Mouratidis & Ampatzidis 2019^]). Note also that satellite image-based DEMs, being radar based, vary greatly over different land surfaces, forests, shrub or herbaceous vegetation, agricultural areas, bare areas, rocky surfaces, wetlands, and artificial surfaces such as cities. Also the radar can penetrate into areas of snow, ice, and sand (as in deserts) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8030108[Mouratidis & Ampatzidis 2019^])."

This requires a levelled radio loop in the <<location>> within the cave and a receiver above ground to determine the location underground. The surface location can then be determined using a <<GPS>>/<<GNSS>> receiver, as usual. With a levelled antenna, an experienced operator can determine a ground zero with an <<accuracy>> of one meter for a 50 m depth (2%) (http://hdl.handle.net/10871/19788[Gibson 1996^], {gibson_radiolocation}[Gibson 2002^]), however, more recent radiolocation beacons have increased the horizontal <<accuracy>> to about 0.5 to 1 per cent (<<goldsheider,Goldsheider & Drew 2014>>, http://caves.org/section/commelect/drupal/files/Presentations/NSS2016%20Cave%20Radio%20Accuracy.pdf[Buecher 2016^]).

msgid "An ‘absence’ is when a particular detection protocol, implemented at a particular location and time, does not result in a detection. True absence occurs in areas where the environmental conditions are unsuitable for a species’ survival. Recording of absences has always been contentious. This is partly because it is very much a result of subjective interpretation and it cannot be vouchered. There are three important and overlapping factors – <<location>>, time and methodology. An annual plant, for example, may not be present as an individual at the time of an observation, but may be present at a different time of the year. The location needs to be bounded and is closely linked to the methodology. <<uncertainty,Uncertainty>> of the location applies as elsewhere in this document. However, it may have additional implications. Though an observation may record that species x was not detected at a particular location at a particular time using a particular methodology, that location has an uncertainty. The uncertainty is saying that the area within which the observation (non-detection) was made is somewhere within the <<radial,radius>> or <<shape>> defined by that uncertainty. It does NOT mean that the absence can be ascribed to the totality of the area described by that uncertainty."

For example, if you took observations every 10 meters along a <<transect>>, and the species was not detected at any of those locations, to what extent can you ascribe an absence to the area covered by the transect? Another methodology may be related to the expertise of the observer. If an expert was intensely searching an area for a species, but at the same time noticed that they hadn’t seen any records of a closely related species, which they would have noticed if it was present – what level of certainty can be given to the surmised observation that the second species is absent from the area?"

If the data are stored taxonomically and not geographically (as is the case in the majority of instances) it is often best to georeference in a batch mode by sorting the locality data electronically, and in this way deal with many records on one map sheet or area at a time and not jump back and forth between map sheets. In other cases, it may be more important to minimize wear and tear on collections, and you may wish to database collections as they are received before distributing duplicates or sending on loan. There may be other good practical reasons to georeference as you go.

There are important implications about workflow and effort that need to be considered when applying additional constraints. For example, if taxon constraints are going to be applied, the <<georeference,georeferencing>> cannot be done strictly on location information, which means it has to be done on occurrence records, or on an index combining location and taxon. This would be much slower than georeferencing based on location alone. A good compromise would be to georeference in multiple stages, with the first stage based on location information, and a subsequent stage including the rest of the occurrence information, and perhaps a final stage of review by collectors to be able to set term:dwc[dwc:georeferenceVerificationStatus] to \"verified by collector\" – the best status a georeference can possibly have."

A combination of these <<shape,shapes>> can represent a town, park, river, junction, or any other <<feature>> or combination of features found on a map. While simple to describe, the task of generating these shapes must account for all the uncertainties, and that can be difficult. Except for the simplest <<locality type,locality types>>, creating shapes is impractical without the aid of digital maps, <<geographic information system,GIS>> software (for buffering, clipping, etc.), and expertise, all of which can be relatively expensive. Also, except for a <<bounding-box>>, which is an extremely simple example, storing a shape in a database can be considerably more complicated than storing a single pair of <<coordinates>> with a scalar uncertainty distance as in the <<point-radius>> method. <<Darwin Core>> (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029715[Wieczorek et al. 2012b^]) offers the field term:dwc[dwc:footprintWKT], in which a <<geometry>> can be stored in the Well-Known Text format (https://www.iso.org/standard/60343.html[ISO 2016^]) accompanied by the <<coordinate reference system>> in the field term:dwc[dwc:footprintSRS].

This is because, not only does the geometry of the feature usually need to be created (unless it is an administrative <<boundary>> or other shape available in a spatial data layer), but also all the points in the feature geometry have to be used in combination with the uncertainties to arrive at a final shape that includes the location with its uncertainties and nothing more. Note that http://www.geo-locate.org/[GEOLocate (Rios 2019)^] does produce an \"error polygon\" (https://epicc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/UsingGeoLocateforCollaborativeGeoreferencing_2016.pdf[Biedron & Famoso 2016^]) in addition to a point-radius, but how this is done is http://www.geo-locate.org/point_radii.html[not documented in detail^]."

Also be aware that coastlines vary greatly at different scales (see https://doi.org/10.17161/bi.v2i0.5[Chapman et al. 2005^]) and rivers are often straightened on smaller scale maps, and can thus include uncertainties far greater than are generally recorded on maps whose accuracies are determined from \"well-defined\" points such as buildings, road intersections, etc. In addition, coastlines and river <<path,paths>> can change greatly over time (https://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/coasts/altering-the-coasts[World Ocean Review 2010^]) and thus the date of the map needs to be taken into account when determining uncertainty."

These potential inaccuracies are a direct consequence of the projection of the map and one's ability to distinguish between two adjacent points, which may be affected by your measuring device and even your eyesight. A straight line distance measurement only works on a map in an equal distance projection, where distance follows the same scale regardless of the orientation. Unless the conditions for measuring are particularly poor, it is reasonable to use 1 mm as a value for measurement error on physical maps. Depending on the scale of the map, this translates into a distance on the ground."

Some sites have tools that are particularly suited for drawing and measuring on maps. In Google Maps, for example, the measuring tool can be initiated by clicking at your starting point or origin, then using right-click to select *_Measure distance_* from a pop-up menu. You can then click on your end point and a line segment with distance indicators will join the two chosen locations. You can click repeatedly to trace a <<path>>, such as along a road or river. You can also close the shape to make a polygon by clicking on the starting point again. Once you have your line or polygon, you can modify the node positions (for example after zooming in further), and add intermediate nodes. It can also be used to determine distance from a point, such as \"5 km N of [feature]\". By closing the polygon, you can get an area as well as total distance. Determine <<uncertainty>> as you would for any other map, but be aware of the effects of the level at which you may be zoomed in. One's capacity to point accurately is higher at higher zoom levels. One can test the effect empirically by trying repeatedly to put a marker on the center of a feature that can be seen at low zoom levels, then checking how far off they are on average at higher zoom levels."

The most common way of getting <<coordinates>> in the field is from a GNSS-enabled device, which includes most smartphones. Most user interfaces on hand-held GPS/GNSS devices and applications on smartphones show a \"GPS Accuracy\". The figure shown as \"Accuracy\" isn't true <<accuracy>>. It is the EPE (Estimated Position Error) (https://interpine.nz/gps-accuracy-estimate-epe-what-is-it/[Herries 2012^]). In other words, it is the probability that the location the GPS is displaying is within the \"accuracy\" distance from the true location. Keep in mind that a GPS receiver doesn't actually know its true location. It calculates a location, based on the data received from the satellites. However, if the instrument has a <<bias>>, it still may give a low reported \"Accuracy\" (i.e. the repeated measurements may be close together) but they may be some distance from the true location (see <<img-accuracy-vs-precision>>). While most GPS manufacturers don’t tell you how they calculate \"accuracy\", you can consider it a figure that says \"most of the time, the displayed location coordinates are within X distance of the GPS receiver\" (where X is the \"accuracy\" figure)."

Without access to a <<SBAS>> (see <<Satellite Based Augmentation System>>), this value can be used only as an indicator of relative accuracy, but it is statistically always less than the real value. This is easy to demonstrate with sufficient repeated measurements of coordinates and purported accuracy at the same well-known location over time. The mean accuracy value will be less than the mean distance shift between the mean coordinate given by all readings (a statistical proxy for the true coordinates) and the individual coordinate readings. https://interpine.nz/gps-accuracy-estimate-epe-what-is-it/[Herries 2012^] recommends doubling the Accuracy (EPE) reported by the GPS Receiver (including smartphones) to get a more realistic representation of true accuracy."

Thus, a record of \"10¼ mi\" may be entered into the database as 10.25 mi. The precision implied in the value 10.25 is thus a <<false precision>> and the real precision should not be assumed to be between 10.24 and 10.26 or between 10.2 and 10.3. The method of https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810412331280211[Wieczorek et al. 2004^], adapted here, bases the estimate of uncertainty on the fractional part of the distance, calculated by dividing 1 by the fractional denominator. The uncertainty would just be half of the precision. For example, 10.5 mi N of Bakersfield could reasonably be expected to mean 10½ mi with a precision of half a mile between 10.25 and 10.75 mi, or 10.5 with an uncertainty of 0.25 mi."

If we ignore all sources of uncertainty except those arising from distance precision, the uncertainty is a bounding box centered on the point 8 km E and 6 km N of the <<corrected center>> of the feature. Each of the distance measurements demonstrates a precision of 1 km. Thus, each side of the box is a total of 1 km in length (0.5 km uncertainty in each cardinal direction from the center). Since we are characterizing the precision as a single distance measurement (1 km), we need the circle that circumscribes the above-mentioned bounding box to get the uncertainty due to the combined distance precisions. The radius of this circle is half the length of the distance precision bounding box, which is equal to one half the square root of two times the distance precision. So, for the above example the uncertainty associated with only the distance precision is one half the square root of two, or 0.707 km."

msgid "Feedback from users can be one of the most valuable resources for improving the <<data quality,quality>> of one’s collections and observations. For this to work, however, the institution needs to set up a good feedback mechanism. There needs to be a process whereby all feedback related to quality are checked and the results documented (see https://doi.org/10.15468/doc.jrgg-a190[Chapman 2005a^] & https://www.gbif.org/document/80528[Chapman 2005b^]). Feedback may be from other institutions holding duplicates of specimens, from users who are carrying out analyses on large amounts of data and find records that are either wrongly <<georeference,georeferenced>>, or wrongly identified, or from users who are carrying out data quality checking on related records. All feedback is important, and should not be ignored. Checks carried out should also always be documented so that the same ‘<<error>>’ is not checked over and over again, for example, with term:dwc[dwc:georeferenceVerificationStatus]. Having a unique way to reference specimens can be important, and makes feedback much more efficient (see <<Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)>>)."

Historical records often have <<locality>> descriptions with <<feature,features>> that do not appear on modern maps or in <<gazetteer,gazetteers>>. To find these localities, it is often necessary to consult several different sources of information. These sources include, but are not limited to catalogue books, field notes, other records with similar localities, other collections, scientific and other publications, websites, online databases, speciality gazetteers, and historical maps.

If georeferencing information is able to be found for difficult locations, then it is worthwhile documenting them for future use, or even publishing the results of your searches, as seldom are unusual localities orphans and you, or others, may come across the same locality again at a later date."

We would further like to acknowledge members of the TDWG Data Quality Interest Group, Task Group 2 and staff at the GBIF Secretariat, especially Laura Russell, Kyle Copas, and Matthew Blissett who provided support for the project in which this document was solicited. Members of the Paleo community, especially Talia Karim and Jessica Bazeley, provided valuable feedback on topics of particular interest to that community. Special mention must be made of Alejandro Tablado for \"complaining\" in the GBIF Georeferencing Workshop in Buenos Aires in 2006 about the lack of treatment of marine considerations in the first version of the Best Practices Guide. The suggestion was much appreciated. We hope that the current document makes up for our lack of attention to the topic in the earlier version."
